## Backstory
Recently, I was going through the [self-hosting 101](https://talks.mrkaran.dev/talks/foss-united-apr-2021.html) slides by [Karan Sharma](https://mrkaran.dev/). Along with the content, the way the slides were presented as HTML pages caught my attention. I quickly opened up the inspect tool to find out how and found a few `bespoke-marp-slide` classes.

A quick search, led me to [Marp](https://marp.app/). It was then I realized that unbeknownst, there was a whole bunch of software doing PPTs with existing OSS technologies. As I searched, I found that just like the JS packages, there were a whole bunch of software targeted as this space. Some of them being [Slidev](https://sli.dev/), [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com/) and [ImpressJS](https://impress.js.org/#/bored).

## Slidev
For some unknown reason, I chose to learn Slidev. The slidev website is sleek and gives a glimpse of what you can do with the framework.
* Create flow diagrams

## Bonus
Some extra-ordinary developers took this even further. You can make and present slides in the **TERMINAL** ! 
* [slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides) 
* [lookatme](https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme).

I continue to be suprised by the power of markdown. This very post is written in markdown. Though Slidev is currently (as of June 2021) in beta, it is ready to be used in your next presentation. It may not replace Powerpoint or Prezi for everyone. But anyone with a basic knowledge of markdown can learn it in no time. I will be tracking this project and would definitely use it in my future presentations.
